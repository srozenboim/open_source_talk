# DBC Open Source Talk Notes

### Open Source Rules

__RULE 1:__ If you find something wrong with a piece of open source software, fix it.

__RULE 2:__ In the event you are unable to adhere to rule 1, tell a maintainer about the problem you found in a polite fashion (and preferably with a detailed example of how to recreate the issue you found).

__RULE 3:__ If you are unable to adhere to either rule 1 or rule 2, do nothing. It's not a good use of anyone's time to be complaining about stuff on the internet. There's enough of that already.

### Why Open Source

* __Giving back:__ People take the time to create amazing pieces of software that they give to the world for free. The least you could do to thank them is to help them in their endeavors.

* __Learning:__ Working on a diversity of projects means you get the opportunity to learn a bunch of stuff from a ton of really great people. Normal 9-5 work is typically much more narrow in scope, but with OSS you can get an incredible breadth of experience.

* __Community:__ OSS is a massive community that brings together people from all over the world, with an incredible variety of experiences and beliefs, to build great stuff. If you want to be part of a broader community of developers, this is a great way to do so!

### How to find a good project to work on (for beginners)

* __Find a project in the _sweet spot_ of size and complexity.__ Your first OSS commit probably won't be to Rails or Node, but that doesn't mean that your first commit should be to a project that isn't widely used and isn't well maintained. Try to find a project that is well used and maintained enough so that it has an active community around it, but not so big that it's hard to get anything done. I recommend projects that have between 300-600 stars on GitHub (which is a totally random and arbitrary number, but seems to work for me).

* __Look at the recent activity of a project to gauge maintainer engagement.__ Is the last merged PR from 2015? Are there issues open from six months ago that don't have any responses by a project maintainer? Then this project may not be the best place to start. Look for somewhere where the maintainers are active, kind, and helpful.

* __Look for projects with helpful tags on issues.__ There are some projects out there that tag issues with various pieces of metadata to help filter them. Some of these projects include tags like `documentation` or `easy` or `beginner` - these are great places to start!

* __Find a project where you'll feel welcome.__ If you feel like it will help you confidently be part of a project's community, look for a project with a good code of conduct. This isn't really important to everyone, but it's very important to some, so it's something to consider.

* __Think about what you want to get out of it.__ Like we mentioned before, there are various reasons people contribute to open source. If you're doing it as a learning opportunity, then looking for a project with extra helpful maintainers is a good call. If you're doing it to give back, then you might want to contribute to a project that you use all the time and love having around.
