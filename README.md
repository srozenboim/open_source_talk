# DBC Open Source Talk Notes

### Open Source Rules

__RULE 1:__ If you find something wrong with a piece of open source software, fix it.

__RULE 2:__ In the event you are unable to adhere to rule 1, tell a maintainer about the problem you found in a polite fashion (and preferably with a detailed example of how to recreate the issue you found).

__RULE 3:__ If you are unable to adhere to either rule 1 or rule 2, do nothing. It's not a good use of anyone's time to be complaining about stuff on the internet. There's enough of that already.

### Why Open Source

* __Giving back:__ People take the time to create amazing pieces of software that they give to the world for free. The least you could do to thank them is to help them in their endeavors.

* __Learning:__ Working on a diversity of projects means you get the opportunity to learn a bunch of stuff from a ton of really great people. Normal 9-5 work is typically much more narrow in scope, but with OSS you can get an incredible breadth of experience.

* __Community:__ OSS is a massive community that brings together people from all over the world, with an incredible variety of experiences and beliefs, to build great stuff. If you want to be part of a broader community of developers, this is a great way to do so!
